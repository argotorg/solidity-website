We are excited to announce the latest release of the Solidity Compiler, [Solidity v0.8.21](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.21).

## Notable New Features

### Stack-to-memory mover always enabled via-IR

The release addresses the issue of unoptimized code produced by the IR-based code generation pipeline being overly prone to "Stack Too Deep" errors.
This is meant to help tools such as debuggers, which lose much of their effectiveness when working with optimized code.

The legacy pipeline can often avoid running out of reachable stack slots even in unoptimized mode, but this comes at the cost of higher complexity since many optimizations are hard-coded as a part of code generation.
The new pipeline was designed from the beginning with the goal of separating these two concerns.
It produces straightforward but very inefficient output that is meant to be refined in discrete steps by the Yul optimizer.
The transformation performed by each step can be verified and reasoned about in isolation.
The downside of this approach is that unoptimized code very often has lots of unused local variables and runs into stack issues.

Our solution is to pass the unoptimized code through minimal transformations that help with stack issues but do not change it significantly as full optimization would.
Specifically, the compiler will now run [`UnusedPruner`](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/internals/optimizer.html#unused-pruner) optimizer step on such code to remove unused variables.
In addition, the stack-to-memory mover mechanism is now always enabled, resolving remaining stack issues, though at the cost of extra memory accesses.

Both of these things were already possible to achieve through existing optimizer settings but were not a part of the default behavior.
Despite technically involving the optimizer module, we consider them an essential part of the new pipeline and the new baseline for what unoptimized code means.

## Important Bugfixes

- Code Generator: Always generate code for the expression in ``<expression>.selector`` in the legacy code generation pipeline. You can read more about it in our blog post [here](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2023/07/19/missing-side-effects-on-selector-access-bug)
- Yul Optimizer: Fix ``FullInliner`` step (``i``) not preserving the evaluation order of arguments passed into inlined functions in code that is not in expression-split form (i.e. when using a custom optimizer sequence in which the step not preceded by ``ExpressionSplitter`` (``x``)). You can read more about it in our blogpost [here](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2023/07/19/full-inliner-non-expression-split-argument-evaluation-order-bug).

## Language Features

- Allow qualified access to events from other contracts.
- Relax restrictions on initialization of immutable variables. Reads and writes may now happen at any point at construction time outside of functions and modifiers. Explicit initialization is no longer mandatory.

## Full Changelog

### Compiler Features

- Commandline Interface: Add ``--ast-compact-json`` output in assembler mode.
- Commandline Interface: Add ``--ir-ast-json`` and ``--ir-optimized-ast-json`` outputs for Solidity input, providing AST in compact JSON format for IR and optimized IR.
- Commandline Interface: Respect ``--optimize-yul`` and ``--no-optimize-yul`` in compiler mode and accept them in assembler mode as well. ``--optimize --no-optimize-yul`` combination now allows enabling EVM assembly optimizer without enabling Yul optimizer.
- EWasm: Remove EWasm backend.
- Parser: Introduce ``pragma experimental solidity``, which will enable an experimental language mode that, in particular, has no stability guarantees between non-breaking releases and is not suited for production use.
- SMTChecker: Add ``--model-checker-print-query`` CLI option and ``settings.modelChecker.printQuery`` JSON option to output the SMTChecker queries in the SMTLIB2 format. This requires using ``smtlib2`` solver only.
- Standard JSON Interface: Add ``ast`` file-level output for Yul input.
- Standard JSON Interface: Add ``irAst`` and ``irOptimizedAst`` contract-level outputs for Solidity input, providing AST in compact JSON format for IR and optimized IR.
- Yul Optimizer: Remove experimental ``ReasoningBasedSimplifier`` optimization step.
- Yul Optimizer: Stack-to-memory mover is now enabled by default whenever possible for via IR code generation and pure Yul compilation.

### Bugfixes

-  Code Generator: Disallow complex expressions whose results are types, built-ins, modules or some unassignable functions. The legacy code generation pipeline would not actually evaluate them, discarding any side effects they might have.
- Code Generator: Fix not entirely deterministic order of functions in unoptimized Yul output. The choice of C++ compiler in some cases would result in different (but equivalent) bytecode (especially from native binaries vs emscripten binaries).
- Commandline Interface: Fix internal error when using ``--stop-after parsing`` and requesting some of the outputs that require full analysis or compilation.
- Commandline Interface: It is no longer possible to specify both ``--optimize-yul`` and ``--no-optimize-yul`` at the same time.
- SMTChecker: Fix encoding of side-effects inside ``if`` and ``ternary conditional``statements in the BMC engine.
- SMTChecker: Fix false negative when a verification target can be violated only by a trusted external call from another public function.
- SMTChecker: Fix generation of invalid SMT-LIB2 scripts in BMC engine with trusted mode for external calls when CHC engine times out.
- SMTChecker: Fix internal error caused by incorrectly classifying external function call using function pointer as a public getter.
- SMTChecker: Fix internal error caused by using an external identifier to encode member access to functions that take an internal function as a parameter.
- Standard JSON Interface: Fix an incomplete AST being returned when the analysis is interrupted by certain kinds of fatal errors.
- Type Checker: Disallow using certain unassignable function types in complex expressions.
- Type Checker: Function declaration types referring to different declarations are no longer convertible to each other.
- Yul Optimizer: Ensure that the assignment of memory slots for variables moved to memory does not depend on AST IDs that may depend on whether additional files are included during compilation.
- Yul Optimizer: Fix ``FullInliner`` step not ignoring code that is not in expression-split form.
- Yul Optimizer: Fix optimized IR being unnecessarily passed through the Yul optimizer again before bytecode generation.
  
### AST Changes

- AST: Add the ``experimentalSolidity`` field to the ``SourceUnit`` nodes, which indicates whether the experimental parsing mode has been enabled via ``pragma experimental solidity``.

## How to install/upgrade

To upgrade to the latest version of the Solidity Compiler,
simply follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/installing-solidity.html) available in our documentation.
Our team has made sure to provide detailed and straightforward steps to make the upgrade process as seamless as possible.
If you have any questions or run into any issues during the upgrade process,
don't hesitate to reach out to our [community Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#ethereum_solidity:gitter.im).

You can download the new version of Solidity here: [v0.8.21](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.21).
If you want to build from the source code, do not use the source archives generated automatically by GitHub,
instead please use [`solidity_0.8.21.tar.gz`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/download/v0.8.21/solidity_0.8.21.tar.gz)
and take a look at [our documentation on how to build from source](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/installing-solidity.html#building-from-source)
if you need guidance.

Please note that for those using Solidity versions below 0.8.0, [there are breaking changes](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/080-breaking-changes.html).
We highly recommend reviewing the detailed list of breaking changes in our documentation to ensure a smooth upgrade process.
Additionally, we encourage all Solidity users to regularly check for updates to stay up-to-date with the latest improvements and optimizations.
We advise all Solidity developers to upgrade to version 0.8.21 to take advantage of these improvements and optimizations.

We highly recommend reviewing the detailed list of breaking changes in our documentation to ensure a smooth upgrade process.
Additionally, we encourage all Solidity users to regularly check for updates to stay up-to-date with the latest improvements and optimizations.
We advise all Solidity developers to upgrade to version 0.8.21 to take advantage of these improvements and optimizations.

The [Solidity Summit](https://soliditylang.org/summit/) has returned! Following the successful organisation of [Solidity Summit 2023 in TÃ¼rkiye](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2023/11/30/solidity-summit-2023-recap/), we are pleased to announce another in-person edition of the event in 2025.

Solidity Summit 2025 will be a part of [DevConnect](https://devconnect.org/) this year and will take place on **Tue, 18 Nov, 2025 in Buenos Aires, Argentina**.

## What can you expect at Solidity Summit 2025?

The Solidity Summit is a collaborative conference that focuses on Solidity's future. It is a gathering of advanced Solidity users and other Solidity ecosystem stakeholders such as language designers, dapp developers, tooling builders, auditors and security researchers.

During the event you will:
- Find out more about the most recent language proposals and new features.
- Hear what's new from Solidity tooling and security researchers.
- Learn from Solidity experts.

## Speaker and attendee applications are now open!

The call for proposals is now open. To apply for a speaking opportunity, [please complete the speaker application form](https://drive.argot.org/form/#/2/form/view/TmZlvgY9qObv9P2OIcv91drpWxWm-7OPuyFT4Tgone0/).

Keep in mind that the Solidity Summit is geared towards an experienced audience, which means we can descent deep into the Solidity weeds or technical things.

## Who is a good fit to speak at the Solidity Summit 2025?

- **(Solidity) Language Shapers**: Experts in Solidity or other EVM smart contract languages can share updates or present improvement ideas and their thoughts.
- **Tooling & app devs**: Developers who build dapps powered by Solidity contracts, IDEs, debuggers, analysis tools or testing frameworks can use this occasion to share best practices, challenges and feedback with the audience.
- **Auditors and Security Researchers**: Security tips, common mistakes and vulnerabilities, insights from audits or suggestions to share are welcome!
- **Solidity Power Users**: Solidity users can share their finest Solidity hacks, takes and tips!

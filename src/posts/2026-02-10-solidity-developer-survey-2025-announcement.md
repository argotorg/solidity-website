The annual Solidity Developer Survey is now live, and we need your input!

**Take 5 minutes to share your experience and help us prioritize language design, performance improvements, and developer experience enhancements for the year ahead.**

We're already working on frequently requested features like eliminating stack-too-deep errors, performance optimization, and stronger debugging tooling – with delivery targeted for H1 2026. Your feedback will help us refine priorities and identify what matters most.

**Check out our latest roadmap update:** [2026 Argot Roadmap Update](https://www.argot.org/blog/2026-01-15-argot-roadmap-update-2026-1#solidity)

## 📝 [Take the Survey!](https://solidity.survey-research.net/solidity-survey)

## The Survey Covers:

- Demographics and developer profiles
- Tooling and usage
- Developer experience
- Core Solidity
- Use of AI

This is the start of a broader, ongoing feedback program with the community. Your voice matters.

You can find the results of the previous Solidity Developer Survey [here](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2025/04/25/solidity-developer-survey-2024-results/). In 2024, a total of 1,342 developers from 89 different countries participated in the survey.

## Why Participate?

Your answers will directly help shape the future of the Solidity language, compiler, and surrounding tooling.

As a thank you, you'll have a chance to win a [Devcon 8](https://devcon.org/en/) ticket (just add your contact details at the end of the survey to enter the raffle).

## Spread the Word!

The more developers we can reach, the more data we will have to guide the roadmap, so please help us share the survey in your networks and reach the right audience!

Keep an eye on the [Solidity Twitter](https://twitter.com/solidity_lang) account for the announcement of the survey results.

The long wait is over: The [Underhanded Solidity Contest](https://underhanded.soliditylang.org/) is back with a 2024 edition!

*add recap for past editions here*

In case you're new to this, let's get you up to speed with a quick recap on what the Underhanded Solidity Contest (USC) is all about:

In a nutshell, the USC is about finding loopholes or "hiding spots" in the Solidity language and using those to write seemingly innocent and straightforward-looking Solidity code which contains malicious behavior or backdoors.

With that, the Underhanded Solidity Contest aims to:

- Raise awareness about smart contract security.
- Uncover language design faults.
- Battle-test recently introduced language features and restrictions.
- Highlight anti-patterns in smart contact development.
- Establish new best practices for secure smart contract development.

So, let's have a look at the 2024 contest specifics, the theme, deadlines, judges, prizes and more!

## Theme: Transient Storage üíæ

Write a smart contract or build a service using Transient Storage that takes the principle of composability for granted.

TBA

## The Judges ‚öñÔ∏è

Judges are presented with anonymised submissions. This year, the submissions will be assessed by:

TBA

### Judging Criteria ‚òëÔ∏è

Remember to consider the following aspects and properties for your submissions:

- **Simplicity & Conciseness**: Since it's much easier to hide a vulnerability in complex and poorly written code, short and clean submissions will be scored higher than those that are lengthy and complicated.
- **Plausibility**: Code that drops down to inline assembly without any clear reason why will look immediately suspicious, no matter how cleverly written the assembly-level flaw is.
- **Originality**: Truly original ideas will receive more points than making use of already well known exploit/backdoor mechanisms.

## The Prizes üèÜ

This year, the first place will receive a ticket to [Devcon VII Bogota](https://devcon.org/).

The top 3 submissions will receive a ticket to the [Devconnect Coworking Space](https://devconnect.org/) and the opportunity to present their contest submission at the next [Solidity Summit](https://summit.soliditylang.org/) (dates & location TBA!).

Furthermore, the three winners will be added to the Board of Fame.

The winners and all qualified submissions will receive a custom Underhanded Solidity Contest t-shirt.

## The Submission üì®

Before submitting your code ensure that:

- The entirety of your submission is licensed under an open-source license.
- In your submission you use Solidity v0.8.0 or newer.
- You have carefully read the [Coding Brief](https://underhanded.soliditylang.org/#coding-brief).

Please email your submissions before the deadline [2024-08-15, 11:59PM UTC] to `sol_underhanded@ethereum.org`. Entries should consist of a ZIP file containing a README describing your submission and how it works, a separate file for spoilers, and one or more Solidity files.

Each person can only enter one submission. If you want to make a team submission, nominate a single person to submit on your team's behalf. Since entries will be forwarded to the judges and assessed anonymously, please do not include identifying information in the ZIP file.

## Contest Timeline ‚è≥

- Submissions open: 2024-07-15
- Submissions close: 2024-08-15
- Winners announced: 2024-09-16

Winners will be announced in time before [Devcon South-east Asia](https://devcon.org/en/).

## The Board of Fame ‚≠ê

To honor all winners of previous Underhanded Solidity Contests, we have introduced the [Board of Fame](https://underhanded.soliditylang.org/#board-of-fame). Consider checking out the hacks of previous winners for inspiration and to make sure you are not using an already known exploit by accident.

## The Supporters üíñ

Last but not least, we'd like to extend our thanks to all the judges for their support in organizing this contest!

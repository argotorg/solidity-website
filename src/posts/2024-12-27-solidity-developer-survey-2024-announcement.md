Before we wrap up the 2024 season, we have one last announcement! 🚀

The annual [Solidity Developer Survey](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/9xjPVmdv8z0Cyyh1ejseMQ0igmx-TedH5CPST3PhRUk/) for the year 2024 is live! Our survey helps us to further improve the language & compiler and shape the future roadmap of Solidity. We are curious to hear your feedback on Solidity and learn about your personal coding preferences!

**📝 [TAKE THE SURVEY!](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/9xjPVmdv8z0Cyyh1ejseMQ0igmx-TedH5CPST3PhRUk/) 📝**

You can find the previous results of the Solidity Developer Survey 2023 [here](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2024/04/03/solidity-developer-survey-2023-results/). In 2023, a total of 474 developers from 71 different countries participated in the survey out of which 46.5% used Solidity daily, and 33.2% weekly.

## About the Survey 🪄

This year marks the 5th time of bringing back the annual Solidity Developer Survey.

Your feedback through the survey plays a pivotal role in important language design decisions and compiler-level improvement. Over the past four year, it has helped shape the future roadmap of Solidity. The survey ultimately results in us gaining a deeper understanding of our community's needs and the current strengths and weaknesses of the language.

The survey consists of several questions that can be categorised based on the following:

- Demographics
- Developer & User Profile
- Solidity Background
- Solidity Developer Experience
- Language Design
- Solidity Developer Community

Completing the survey will roughly require 10 minutes of your time.

## Spread the Word! 🗣

We have been running this survey for a few years now and we would love to reach even more developers each time. **Please help us share the survey in your networks and reach the right audience!**

Stay tuned on [Solidity Twitter](https://twitter.com/solidity_lang)/[Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@solidity) for the announcement regarding the survey results that will be shared on this blog in Q1 of 2025.

Thank you for your support!

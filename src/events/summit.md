## The Solidity Summit is a collaborative event focusing on the future of [Solidity](/).

We're excited to bring back Solidity Summit for another edition, again as part of the [Devconnect](https://devconnect.org/schedule) week! 

Speaker and attendee applications for 2023 are now closed and ticket vouchers have been distributed.

You can follow Solidity on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/solidity_lang) or monitor the [Solidity blog](/blog) not to miss any updates about the event.

## Keep up with the newest developments in the Solidity space.

The Solidity Summit is a free interactive forum with discussions and talks on Solidity, Yul, language design, security, and tooling.

During the event, you can expect to:

- Get up to speed with the latest language proposals and new features.
- Hear updates from Solidity tooling and security experts.
- Learn from Solidity power users.

We aim to have useful discussions that result in language improvement proposals and, ultimately in actual implementations. Furthermore, we want to foster communication between teams working on similar topics and identify needs for the smart contract ecosystem of Ethereum.

Solidity Summit 2023 is part of [Devconnect Istanbul](https://devconnect.org/) and will be a one-day forum for the Solidity ecosystem. It is for all people involved and interested in the Solidity language and the tooling around it.

## Who can join?

The Solidity Summit focuses on advanced Solidity users and other stakeholders of the Solidity ecosystem, such as tool builders, auditors, and security researchers.

#### Solidity Language Shapers

Experts in Solidity, or other EVM smart contract languages, can share updates, or present improvement ideas and their thoughts.

#### Tooling Builders & Auditors

IDE developers, debuggers, analysis tools, or testing frameworks can use this occasion to share updates with the audience.

#### Solidity Enthusiasts

Seasoned Solidity users can share their finest Solidity hacks, tips, and comments!

## What will we talk about?

This year, presentations and discussions will revolve around the following topics:

- Solidity and Yul
- Language changes or extension proposals
- Long-term future of Solidity (Verkle tree support, experimental Solidity, etc.)
- Feedback on recently introduced features
- Unification/extension of the ABI
- Tooling, debuggers and debugging data output
- Testing frameworks
- Source verification
- Layer 2 support, cross-chain support
- Mechanisms/programming patterns (on the EVM) like mutexes, state machines, upgradeable contracts, libraries, create2, etc.

## What does the program look like this year?

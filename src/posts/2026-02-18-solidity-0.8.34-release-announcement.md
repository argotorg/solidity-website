Today we are releasing version [0.8.34](https://github.com/argotorg/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.34) of the Solidity Compiler.
This is a bugfix release that patches an important bug of high severity.

**If your code does not use `delete` on a transient state variable, your contract is not affected.**

Only three deployed contracts matching the affected pattern have been identified across all EVM-compatible chains.
The respective teams have been notified and measures have been taken to mitigate potential impact.
Projects that compile with `--via-ir` and use `delete` on transient storage are urged to update.

## Important Bugfixes

### Transient Storage Clearing Helper Collision Bug

A bug in the IR code generator was reported by [Hexens](https://hexens.io/).
When a contract deletes both a persistent and a transient state variable of a matching underlying type, the compiler will emit the wrong storage opcode (`sstore` instead of `tstore`, or vice versa), because the generated Yul helper function name does not distinguish between the two storage locations.
The collision does not require the declared types to match. It is sufficient for the underlying value types to coincide, for example through struct members, array elements, or the type normalization performed during array clearing.

The bug affects compiler versions 0.8.28 through 0.8.33 and only manifests when using the IR pipeline.
The legacy evmasm pipeline is not affected.
Since `--via-ir` is not enabled by default, projects that have not explicitly opted into it are not affected.

Depending on which `delete` the compiler encounters first during IR generation, the consequences are:

- **Unintended writes to persistent storage**: A transient `delete` incorrectly emits `sstore`, potentially overwriting unrelated persistent state such as access-control variables.
- **Ineffective persistent deletes**: A persistent `delete` incorrectly emits `tstore`, writing to transient storage (cleared at end of transaction) instead of removing the value from persistent storage.

## Full Changelog

### Important Bugfixes
* Code Generator: Fix incorrect storage opcode in `storageSetToZeroFunction` when a contract deletes both persistent and transient state variables whose types resolve to the same cache key via the IR pipeline, caused by the internal function cache not including the storage location in its key.

## How to Install/Upgrade?

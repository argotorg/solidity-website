Today, we announce the release of the Solidity Compiler [v0.8.23](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.23). This newest version of the compiler is meant to be a purely bugfix release that includes the fix for an important yet low severity bug that was reported in the previous version. In case you missed it, you can read the announcement for 0.8.22 [here](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2023/10/25/solidity-0.8.22-release-announcement).

Based on our investigations, we do not forsee real-world instances of the bug being used as an exploit or an attack vector and thus, it has been gievn the low severity tag.

## Important Bugfixes

### Fixing the `verbatim` invalid deduplication bug

A user reported a block deduplicator bug which led to blocks which are identical apart from the contents of verbatim instructions to be treated as equivalent and thus collapsed into a single one. The new release fixes this bug.

## Full Changelog

### Compiler Features:

* Commandline Interface: An empty --yul-optimizations sequence can now be always provided.
* Standard JSON Interface: An empty optimizerSteps sequence can now always be provided.

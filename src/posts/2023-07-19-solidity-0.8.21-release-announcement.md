We are excited to announce the latest release of the Solidity Compiler, [Solidity v0.8.21](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.21).
This latest version includes a range of improvements in ...

### Important Bugfixes
- Code Generator: Always generate code for the expression in ``<expression>.selector`` in the legacy code generation pipeline.
- Yul Optimizer: Fix ``FullInliner`` step (``i``) not preserving the evaluation order of arguments passed into inlined functions in code that is not in expression-split form (i.e. when using a custom optimizer sequence in which the step not preceded by ``ExpressionSplitter`` (``x``)).

### Language Features

- Allow qualified access to events from other contracts.
- Relax restrictions on initialization of immutable variables. Reads and writes may now happen at any point at construction time outside of functions and modifiers. Explicit initialization is no longer mandatory.

### Bugfixes

-  Code Generator: Disallow complex expressions whose results are types, built-ins, modules or some unassignable functions. The legacy code generation pipeline would not actually evaluate them, discarding any side effects they might have.
- Code Generator: Fix not entirely deterministic order of functions in unoptimized Yul output. The choice of C++ compiler in some cases would result in different (but equivalent) bytecode (especially from native binaries vs emscripten binaries).
- Commandline Interface: Fix internal error when using ``--stop-after parsing`` and requesting some of the outputs that require full analysis or compilation.
- Commandline Interface: It is no longer possible to specify both ``--optimize-yul`` and ``--no-optimize-yul`` at the same time.
- SMTChecker: Fix encoding of side-effects inside ``if`` and ``ternary conditional``statements in the BMC engine.
- SMTChecker: Fix false negative when a verification target can be violated only by a trusted external call from another public function.
- SMTChecker: Fix generation of invalid SMT-LIB2 scripts in BMC engine with trusted mode for external calls when CHC engine times out.
- SMTChecker: Fix internal error caused by incorrectly classifying external function call using function pointer as a public getter.
- SMTChecker: Fix internal error caused by using an external identifier to encode member access to functions that take an internal function as a parameter.
- Standard JSON Interface: Fix an incomplete AST being returned when the analysis is interrupted by certain kinds of fatal errors.
- Type Checker: Disallow using certain unassignable function types in complex expressions.
- Type Checker: Function declaration types referring to different declarations are no longer convertible to each other.
- Yul Optimizer: Ensure that the assignment of memory slots for variables moved to memory does not depend on AST IDs that may depend on whether additional files are included during compilation.
- Yul Optimizer: Fix ``FullInliner`` step not ignoring code that is not in expression-split form.
- Yul Optimizer: Fix optimized IR being unnecessarily passed through the Yul optimizer again before bytecode generation.

## How to install/upgrade

To upgrade to the latest version of the Solidity Compiler,
simply follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/installing-solidity.html) available in our documentation.
Our team has made sure to provide detailed and straightforward steps to make the upgrade process as seamless as possible.
If you have any questions or run into any issues during the upgrade process,
don't hesitate to reach out to our [community Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#ethereum_solidity:gitter.im).

You can download the new version of Solidity here: [v0.8.21](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.21).
If you want to build from the source code, do not use the source archives generated automatically by GitHub,
instead please use [`solidity_0.8.21.tar.gz`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/download/v0.8.21/solidity_0.8.21.tar.gz)
and take a look at [our documentation on how to build from source](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/installing-solidity.html#building-from-source)
if you need guidance.

Please note that for those using Solidity versions below 0.8.0, [there are breaking changes](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/080-breaking-changes.html).
We highly recommend reviewing the detailed list of breaking changes in our documentation to ensure a smooth upgrade process.
Additionally, we encourage all Solidity users to regularly check for updates to stay up-to-date with the latest improvements and optimizations.
We advise all Solidity developers to upgrade to version 0.8.21 to take advantage of these improvements and optimizations.

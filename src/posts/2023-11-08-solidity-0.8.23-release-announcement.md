We are excited to announce the release of the Solidity Compiler [v0.8.23](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.23). This newest version of the compiler includes an important bug fix from the previous version as well as some new compiler improvements.

## Important Bugfixes:

* Optimizer: Fix block deduplicator bug which led to blocks which are identical apart from the contents of verbatim instructions to be treated as equivalent and thus collapsed into a single one.

## Compiler Features:

* Commandline Interface: An empty --yul-optimizations sequence can now be always provided.
* Standard JSON Interface: An empty optimizerSteps sequence can now always be provided.

## Bugfixes:

## How to install/upgrade?

To upgrade to the latest version of the Solidity Compiler, please follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.23/installing-solidity.html) available in our documentation.

You can download the new version of Solidity here: [v0.8.23](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.23). If you want to build from the source code, do not use the source archives generated automatically by GitHub. Instead use [`solidity_0.8.23.tar.gz`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/download/v0.8.23/solidity_0.8.23.tar.gz) and take a look at [our documentation on how to build from source](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.23/installing-solidity.html#building-from-source).

We advise all Solidity developers to always upgrade to the latest version of Solidity in order to take advantage of improvements, optimizations, and most importantly, bug fixes.

We are excited to announce the release of the Solidity Compiler [v0.8.27](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.27).

This newest version of the compiler brings legacy support for custom errors in `require`, optimizer improvements such as caching of optimized IR that will speed up compilation via IR, several bugfixes, and more!


## Notable Features

### Legacy Support for `require` with Custom errors

Custom errors in Solidity that provide a convenient and gas-efficient way to explain to the user why an operation failed.

Support for using  errors with the `require` function has been a highly anticipated feature in Solidity.

Until the previous release of the compiler, using custom errors with `require` was only supported by the IR pipeline, i.e. compilation via Yul.

With the release of 0.8.27, you can use the feature for the legacy pipeline as well. We are introducing a new overloadâ€”`require(bool, error)` to support custom errors. This overload will revert with `Error(string)`.


To learn more about the feature and how to use it, check out the example from [our previous release announcement](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2024/05/21/solidity-0.8.26-release-announcement).

### Improved Yul Optimizer

This new version  of the compiler introduces two new improvements in the Yul optimizer.

- Caching of optimized IR to speed up optimization of contracts with bytecode dependencies.


- The optimizer now treats some previously unrecognized identical literals as identical.

## Full Changelog

### Language Features

* Accept declarations of state variables with ``transient`` data location (parser support only, no code generation yet).
 * Make ``require(bool, Error)`` available when using the legacy pipeline.
 * Yul: Parsing rules for source location comments have been relaxed: Whitespace between the location components as well as single-quoted code snippets are now allowed.

### Compiler Features

* Commandline Interface: Add ``--transient-storage-layout`` output.
 * Commandline Interface: Allow the use of ``--asm-json`` output option in assembler mode to export EVM assembly of the contracts in JSON format.
 * Commandline Interface: Do not perform IR optimization when only unoptimized IR is requested.
 * Constant Optimizer: Uses ``PUSH0`` if supported by the selected evm version.
 * Error Reporting: Unimplemented features are now properly reported as errors instead of being handled as if they were bugs.
 * EVM: Support for the EVM version "Prague".
 * Peephole Optimizer: ``PUSH0``, when supported, is duplicated explicitly instead of using ``DUP1``.
 * Peephole Optimizer: Remove identical code snippets that terminate the control flow if they occur one after another.
 * SMTChecker: Add CHC engine check for underflow and overflow in unary minus operation.
 * SMTChecker: Replace CVC4 as a possible BMC backend with cvc5.
 * Standard JSON Interface: Add ``transientStorageLayout`` output.
 * Standard JSON Interface: Do not perform IR optimization when only unoptimized IR is requested.
 * Yul: Drop the deprecated typed Yul dialect that was only accessible via ``--yul`` in the CLI.
 * Yul: The presence of types in untyped Yul dialects is now a parser error.
 * Yul Optimizer: Caching of optimized IR to speed up optimization of contracts with bytecode dependencies.
 * Yul Optimizer: The optimizer now treats some previously unrecognized identical literals as identical.

### Bugfixes

* Assembler: Fix ICE caused by imprecise calculation of required size of tags in bytecode when code size is above 255.
 * Parser: Fix spuriously emitted parser error for unary plus operations when used as binary operator in some cases.
 * SMTChecker: Fix error that reports invalid number of verified checks for BMC and CHC engines.
 * SMTChecker: Fix formatting of unary minus expressions in invariants.
 * SMTChecker: Fix internal compiler error when reporting proved targets for BMC engine.
 * SMTChecker: Fix SMT logic error when assigning to an array of contracts or functions.
 * Standard JSON Interface: For Yul input, properly produce output artifacts in case of warnings.
 * TypeChecker: Fix segfault when assigning nested tuple to tuple.
 * Yul IR Code Generation: Deterministic order of Yul subobjects.
 * Yul Optimizer: Fix Yul source locations always referring to unoptimized source, even in optimized outputs.
 * Yul Optimizer: Fix warnings being generated twice when there are no errors.
 * Yul Optimizer: Name simplification could lead to forbidden identifiers with a leading and/or trailing dot, e.g., ``x._`` would get simplified into ``x.``.
 * Yul Parser: Fix segfault when parsing very long location comments.

### Build System

* Change build system to use git submodules for some dependencies (nlohmann-json, fmtlib & range-v3).

## How to Install/Upgrade?

To upgrade to the latest version of the Solidity Compiler, please follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.27/installing-solidity.html) available in our documentation.

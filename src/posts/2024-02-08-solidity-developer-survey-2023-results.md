We are thrilled to share with you the [Solidity Developer Survey 2023](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2023/12/08/solidity-developer-survey-2023-announcement/) results! In this blog post, we will be going over key insights and detailed analysis of the various sections of the survey.

Before we dive in, we would like to thank everyone who submitted a response to the survey as well as helped us reach the right audience for it! Your inputs are invaluable to us and are pivotal in driving important language design decisions and improving Solidity as an open source project.

This year, we received a total of 474 responses. Let's start with some useful links:

- In the spirit of open source, you can find all raw data of the survey results [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R8EBUryePhiJwl14IXNm2RDwqA8sEBdxrKuFKvfj0wY/edit?usp=sharing) and all graphs [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W49GWlhdxC_I1dxqzFIf1e9bFf8O_QH2kT_T_nfenA0/edit?usp=sharing).
- This is our third annual survey. You can compare the 2023 results with the previous years by checking our the blog posts below:

    - [2020](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/01/26/solidity-developer-survey-2020-results/)

Without further ado, let’s dig into the 2023 results!

## Summary & Notable Insights

The survey consists of 6 sections, namely: **[1]** Demographics, **[2]** Dev & User Profiles, **[3]** Solidity Background, **[4]** Solidity Developer Experience, **[5]** Language Design, and **[6]** Solidity Developer Community.

Let's look at some key insights from and the summary of these various sections from the 2023 survey.

- **Demographics**: In total, 474 developers from 71 different countries participated in the 2023 survey. The highest number of respondents hail from the **USA (18.8%)**, followed by **India (10.5%)**, and **Nigeria (6.2%)**. This remains consistent with last year's insights except for Nigeria replacing France as the 3rd country where the highest respondents live.

## Demographics

_⚠️ Be aware that this survey has only been shared in English when interpreting results regarding the distribution of countries of residency and language preferences._

Let's begin by analysing the first section of the survey which covers information about the residency and native languages/language preferences of the respondents.

In total, 474 developers from 71 different countries participated in the 2023 survey. 

The coverage of different geographies increased from 73 countries in 2021 to 100 countries in 2022 and back to 71 in 2023. It is interesting to note a massive spike in responses in the year 2022.

### Residency

From the 2023 survey, 18.8% of respondents mentioned that they live in the USA, followed by India (10.5%), Nigeria (6.2%), and Germany (5.3%).

This is quite consistent with the previous year with the exception of Nigeria and Germany ranking higher than France with more number of responses.

![Participants World Map](slide3)

![List of Countries with 9+ responses](slide4)

### Language

In the 2023 survey, a total of 60 languages were submitted as the native languages of the respondents.

32.6% of the total participants speak English as their native language, 13.1% speak Indian languages, 7.5% speak Spanish, 6.7% speak French, 5.2% speak Chinese languages, 4.9% speak German, 4.3% speak Russian, and 1.3% speak African languages.

_ℹ️ **Note:** Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, Odia, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu were clustered as “Indian languages”. Cantonese, Chinese, and Mandarin were clustered as “Chinese languages”. Igbo, Kinyarwanda, Kiswahili, Runyankole, Luganda, Swahili, and Yoruba were clustered as African languages._

It is interesting to note newer African languages such as  Kinyarwanda, Kiswahili, Runyankole, and Luganda have entered the survey results this year.

![Participants Native Languages](slide5)

![Participants Native Languages](slide6)

More than half of the of respondents (54.2%) predominantly speak their native language at work, whereas 45.8% still speak another language at work.

A total of 75.4% respondents reported that they predominantly speak English at work, followed by Chinese Languages, Indian Languages, Spanish, and French distributed almost equally.

![Participants Work Language](slide7)

A total of 84.8% participants stated that they are okay with reading the Solidity documentation in English.

However, 15.2% participants prefer to read the documentation in their native language. The number of respondents who would prefer it in their native language are slightly higher this year than the previous year (12.9%).

![Preferred Language for Docs](slide8)

![Preferred Language for Docs Breakdown](slide9)

_ℹ️ Note: This survey has only been conducted in English, which may have impacted the outcome of this question. We still believe internationalization of resources like the Solidity documentation is a crucial factor in lowering the barrier of entry, and we aim to support this by helping coordinate the community-driven [translation efforts](https://github.com/solidity-docs)._

![header 2](/img/2024/survey/header2.png)

## Dev & User Profile

In the second section of the Solidity Developer Survey, we gather insights about the professional background of our devs/users and learn about their preferences about coding languages, open source contributions, OS, & more.

### Employment & Work Experience

65.2% of respondents were employed at the time of the survey, while 13.4% stated that they were students. 21.4% reported that they were currently not employed.

Compared to the previous survey, there is a slight increase in both the number of students and currently unemployed developers or users.

![Employment Status](slide12)

69.6% of the total participants who were employed at the time work in the “crypto”, whereas 14.7% work in technology in general and 4.5% work in financial services.

This trend is quite comparable to the results from the previous year with just a slight change in the individual precentages.

![Industry Sector Breakdown](slide13)

Roughly 36% of all respondents are considered seniors in their field and have been coding professionally for 6+ years, out of which 9.7% have even been coding for 15+ years.

On the contrary, roughly 6.1% have never coded as part of their job and 9% have only coded professionally for less than a year.

As a majority, 28.3% of repondents are mid-level programmers with 3-5 years of experience.

Overall, the level of professional coding experience is medium to high with the majority of respondents (64.5%) having coded professionally for 3+ years.

![Professional Coding Experience](slide14)

### Developer Profiles

When asked which developer profile best describes the participants, the majority identified with being Smart Contract Developers, followed by Tooling developers, Auditor / Security experts, and Academic researchers.

![Dev Profiles](slide15)

About 75.3% of the users use Solidity at work as well as for personal projects and 24.7% use it only for personal projects.

![Solidity usage](slide16)

A cummulative of 43.7% users contribute to open source projects on a regular basis (daily and weekly), whereas 27.1% only contribute on a monthly basis. Almost 41% users reported that they never contribute to open source.

The number of users who never contribute has reduced this year with an increase in the number of daily or weekly contributors.

![Open Source Contributions](slide17)

### Programming Language Preferences

Yet again this year, Solidity ranks as the most used programming language among the participants (42.9%), closely followed by TypeScript (16.7%), and JavaScript (15.4%).

We observed a big hike in Solidity users going from 28.9% last year to 42.9% this year. JavaScript and TypeScript seem to have swapped places this year.

Other less frequently mentioned languages are Python (9.5%), Rust (3.5%), and C# (2.4%), and C++ (2.2%).

![Most Used Programming Language](slide18)

When asked about the favourite language of the participant, Solidity ranks the highest with 29.1% of the votes, followed by Python (15.6%), JavaScript (12.4%), TypeScript (12%), and Rust (10%).

Some other that were mentioned are Rust, Go, C++, Java, and a few others.

![Favorite Programming Language](slide19)

### Preferred Operating System

Majority of the participants use MacOS as their primary Operating System (40.5%). Linux and Windows are equally popular, with 29.9 and 29.7% respectively.

![Operating System](slide20)

![header 3](/img/2024/survey/header3.png)

## Solidity Background

In the next section of the survey, we collected information regarding Solidity-specific development experience and usage habits of the participants.

### Solidity Expertise

Almost 60% of all respondents deem themselves Solidity experts, with a self rating in expertise of 7 or higher (scale of 10) out of which participants with self-rating 8 are the highest in number.

23.4% rated themselves as an expert (self-rating 10) and roughly 84% of those have been using Solidity for 2+ years.

Roughly 20% of all who responded are beginners with a self-rating of 4 or less.

![Solidity Expertise](slide22)

We asked the participants about how long have they been using Solidity for. Almost 30% of all respondents have been using Solidity for less than a year, with 10% with less than three months of experience using Solidity.

The highest number of respondents (24.5%) are users who have 2-3 years of experience in Solidity.

About 24% of users who can be considered seniors in the ecosystem are respondents who have been using Solidity for 3+ years.

![Solidity Experience Level](slide23)

When asked how long it took the respondents to start feeling productive with Solidity, majority of them (36.7%) reported that it took them less than 6 months.

17.8% even said that it only took them less than a month.

12.7% needed more than a year to feel comfortable with the language. This number is slightly higher than the last year.

17.4% don't feel productive yet, out of which 76.7% are beginners and have been using Solidity for 6 months or less, and 45% even less than three months.

![Time to Productiveness](slide24)

### Solidity User Profile and Usage Habits

With regards to usage frequency, more than 40% of respondents use Solidity on a daily basis!

37.3% use it weekly, and 13.9% on a monthly basis.

Roughly 8% indicated to be using Solidity "rarely" or "never".

Most of them indicated before that they use Solidity for personal projects and code in a different programming language at work.

![Solidity Usage Frequency](/img/2023/02/sol_frequency.png)

A striking 81.8% of all respondents use Visual Studio Code as their editor when writing Solidity code.
Vim and IntelliJ follow in the second and third ranks with 3.7 and 3.4% usage, respectively.

Compared to the previous survey in 2021, Visual Studio code gained significantly in popularity (from roughly 50% to 81.8%).

![Editor Overview](/img/2023/02/editor.png)

Depending on the chosen IDE, we also asked respondents which Solidity-related plugins they use, if any.

“HardHat VSCode” by Nomic Foundation and the “Solidity” extension by Juan Blanco (both for Visual Studio Code) are the most popular.

![Editor Plugins Overview](/img/2023/02/editor_plugins.png)

Hardhat remains the most popular Ethereum-specific development environment, with roughly 75% of all respondents using Hardhat.

Remix follows with 42%. Foundry has significantly increased its share from 1.6% in 2021 to 30% in 2022.

Truffle continues to move more into the background, with 17% of respondents indicating that they use it.

Rather "niche" Ethereum-specific development environments are Brownie (6.7%), Ape (3.3%), Dapptools (2.3%), and Embark (0.8%).

4.4% of respondents are not using any Ethereum-specific development environment.

It’s worth noting that this question was a checkbox question, allowing respondents to select multiple answers.

_⚠️ Comparing the results from 2020, 2021, to 2022 may offer some insights like Truffle losing a significant share (2020: 59.3% -> 2021: 26.2% -> 2022: 17%), while Hardhat, and newcomers like Foundry increased their share in users. However, it's important to consider that the previous surveys had significantly fewer responses (2020: 194, 2021: 435, 2022: 1401). A year-on-year comparison can only be interpreted as a loose trend and it’s not the intent of this study to analyze user splits between IDEs in detail._

![Ethereum IDE Overview](/img/2023/02/eth_ide.png)

With roughly 90%, 0.8.x Solidity versions remain to be the by far most used ones. The usage share of both the 0.7.x (10.2%) and the 0.6.x (7.7%) series continues to decrease since the previous survey. Everything older than that is hardly in use anymore.

![Used Solidity Versions](/img/2023/02/versions.png)

_⚠️ Reminder: Please make sure to frequently update your code (and compiler) to the latest Solidity version. [Several important bug fixes and security improvements](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/bugs_by_version.json) are added in the newer versions!_

### Solidity Usage Details

Just like last year, we also asked our users specific questions about Solidity usage trends.

For charts and figures on those, please refer to the [presentation with all graphs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xH5pGZ6rrAP_jzRQobf0Mn1XYquyg8bD17DBQyrErMo/edit?usp=sharing) and the [raw data file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5iF3aKhFv9wTTJ10ko_uxgoflc8oEpVe3gqAAWoC2w/edit?usp=sharing).

To summarize:

- CLI: Roughly 60% of respondents do not use the Solidity compiler directly via the command line, while 40.1% do. This is quite consistent with last year.
- CLI: When using the compiler on the command line, 58.9% still use Standard JSON.
- CLI: When asked how disruptive are changes in CLI options and outputs for respondents, 64.1% responded with "okay" and 26.5% with "Not disruptive at all". Only 9.4% deem these changes as disruptive.
- Old EVM versions: 28.8% of the overall respondents still rely on old EVM versions, among which 11.1% rely on deprecated EVM versions.
- Unoptimised code: 20.8% said that they never use unoptimised code. 27.9% use unoptimised code only because of their framework's defauly settings, whereas 20.1% do so due to debugging or unit testing (19.4%).
- ABIEncoderV1: While 63.9% do not use ABIEncoderV1, only 6.5% know about it and use it. 29.6$ do not know about it at all.
- SMTChecker: 74.5% of all respondents never use the SMTChecker. 20.1% have tried it and 5.4% use it frequently. You can learn more about the SMTChecker [here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/smtchecker.html). The number of users who have tried it has increased this year.
- `via-IR` compilation pipeline: 51.9% do not know what `via-IR` is. This number has significantly reduced from last year. 25.9% use the `via-IR` pipeline already. In the following weeks, we intend to write a blog post about what `via-IR` is and why you should switch from the legacy compilation pipeline to `via-IR`. When asked what users are most concerned about regarding the use of `via-IR`, 27.4% said compilation times, 21.4% said not enough knowledge, 17.9% said stability/security concerns, and 13.5% said lack of tooling.
- Metadata publication: 55.2% publish the metadata of their smart contracts which has slightly increased from last year. 30.3.5% don’t, while 14.5% don’t know what this means and both these numbers have significantly improved from last year.
- Sourcify: 14.2% of all respondents use Sourcify for smart contract verification (increased from last year), while 30.7% claim to not need it. 55% don’t know what Sourcify is, which has reduced from last year. A staggering 79% users use Sourcify via Foundry and 16.1% use it via Sourcify directly. If you want to learn more about Sourcify, visit [sourcify.dev](https://sourcify.dev/).
- `appendCBOR: false` or `bytecodeHash: none`: 55% users do not know what that is, whereas 30.8% know but do not need it. Only about 13.7% either use it frequently or sometimes.
- Flattening contracts: 53.9% of total respondents do not flatten their contracts, whereas only 22.5% do. 23.6% do not know what that is or how to do it. Most of the users who flatten their contracts mentioned that they do so for the purpose of verification.

### Other EVM Networks

More than half of all respondents (65.1%) use Solidity outside of [Ethereum Mainnet](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#mainnet) and [testnets](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#testnet).

When asked which other networks they deploy their smart contracts on, 20.8% responded with Polygon (formerly Matic Network).

Other often mentioned blockchains including Arbitrum (15.6%), Optimism (13.2%),  Binance Smart Chain (10.6%), and Avalanche (8.1%).

![Deployment To Other Chains](slide47)

![Deployment To Other Chains Breakdown](slide48)

### Other Smart Contract Languages

[Yul](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/yul.html), an intermediate language for Solidity, continues to the be the most used smart contract language other than Solidity with 23.9% respondents; a slight increase than last year.

[Vyper](https://docs.vyperlang.org), a pythonic EVM language, with 11.9% ranks as the second most used language other than Solidity.

This trend is similar to last year so far with just a small increase in the percentages.

The group [Huff](https://docs.huff.sh) (9.3%), [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/) (5.8%), and [Sway](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/) (2.1%) make it to the list second year in a row.

[Fe](https://fe-lang.org/docs/) (1.8%) also makes it into the chart yet again with the exception of Rust missing the cut this year.

![Other Smart Contract Languages](slide49)

![header 4](/img/2024/survey/header4.png)

## Solidity Developer Experience

In this next section of the survey, we will be going through the developer experience of our user community.

When asked about the overall improvement in the Solidity developer experience, 76% of all respondents generally believe that it has improved in the last year with 20.2% even believing it was a big improvement.

As low as 1.6% of the respondents are of the opinion that the developer experience has gotten worse.

With the exception of a slight increase in “got worse” and “no change” and a small decrease in "big improvement" votes, the overall results of this chart are quite comparable across the previous year and this year.

![Solidity Developer Experience](slide51)

### Recurring Issues

When asked if the participants encounter recurring issues, 53.3% of the total respondents said that they do not come across the same or similar issues multiple times when developing in Solidity.

Among the 46.7% that encounter recurring issues, Stack too deep issues are encountered most frequently, followed by Bytecode size limit and Debugging issues.

![Recurring issues](slide52)

![Recurring issues](slide53)

_ℹ️ **Note:** On the topic of debugging issues, we would to remind you about the ethdebug standards development working group, an initiative aimed at defining a common debugging data format for languages built on top of the EVM: [ethdebug](https://github.com/ethdebug/format/).

We encourage all developers working on such tools to join the working group. The group has regular bi-weekly meetings and coordinates via the [ethdebug Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#ethdebug:matrix.org)._

### Getting Started with the Compiler

When asked how easy was it to get started with the Solidity compiler, most respondents are of the opinion that it is very easy (44.8%) or “okay” (50.9%).

As less as 4.3% shared that it was difficult for them to get started with the compiler. When asked what made it difficult to get started, some mentioned lack of good docs and examples.

![Getting Started](slide54)

### Most liked Aspects/Features & Pain Points

23.5% respondents most like the aspect of Solidity that makes it similar to other programming languages.

Others like it is easy to learn (17.4%), statically typed (16.3%), simple (15.4%).

Some also consider its syntax (12.7%) and the ease of reading (10.4%) as the most likeable aspects.

![Most liked aspect](slide55)

33.8% of the respondents consider mappings as their most liked feature, followed by contracts as objects being the second most popular feature (23.2%).

Modifiers (16.1%) and Inline Assembly (12.6%) were noticed to be quite higher up in the list as well.

Some users reported User defined types (6%), dynamic arrays (3.4%), and `using for` (2.5%) as their most liked features. 

![Most liked feature](slide56)

When we asked the participants about their biggest pain points with Solidity, the Stack too deep errors ranked the highest with 42% of all votes, followed by missing memory optimizations (21.6%) and compiler performance (13%).

8.6% of respondents said that redundant checks (e.g. in checked arithmetic) is their biggest issue.

Almost 11% selected “OTHER” and specified some of their most significant pain points, namely: Bytecode and contract size limit and errors.

![Solidity Pain Points](slide57)

### Documentation

When asked if the participants find the official documentaiton helpful, 68% of the survey respondents reported the Solidity documentation to be helpful, followed by 29.1% who consider it somewhat useful.

As low as 2.9% voted that they do not find the docs useful at all.

Ideas for improvement most prominently ask for more code examples but also a better high-level overview of syntax, better in-docs search, and overall better UI/UX.

![Solidity Documentation Usefulness](slide58)

### High-Impact Compiler Bugs

We were curious to find out whether Solidity developers had been affected by any of the high-impact compiler bugs (codegen bugs that are announced with [Security Alerts](https://blog.soliditylang.org/category/security-alerts/) on the Solidity blog).

While 95.7% said they haven't been affected, 4.3% said yes. 

When asked which one they were affected by, here's what we found out:

(double check if reported bugs are genuine and list accordingly)

![High impact compiler bugs](slide59)

### External Libraries

The majority of the survey respondents (47.8%) do not know what external libraries are (or are for).

However, 42.7% reported that they use it and specified some use-cases such as contract splitting, proxy patterns, and sharing code.

Only 9.5% users do not use external libraries at all.

![External libraries](slide60)

![header 5](/img/2024/survey/header5.png)

## Language Design & Upcoming Features

In the following section of the survey, we will take you through the insights we drew from asking our participants about their thoughts on and involvement in the Solidity language design updates and efforts.

### Most Anticipated Feature(s)

23.2% of total respondents shared that their most anticipated feature is the support for generics, followed by 17.4% reporting that they most look forward to the `Require` with custom error types feature.

_⚠️ Note: Similar to the previous year, we have categorized the use of verious terms like "floats", "floating point arithmetic", "floating point number", "fixed point numbers", and "fixed point math" as "decimal numbers"._

Other most anticipated features in descending order:

- Transient storage (13%)
- Solving stack-too-deep errors (11.6%)
- Better gas optimizations & debugging tools (10.1%)
- Support for decimal numbers & Dynamic Memory Arrays (7.2%)

![Most anticipated features](slide63)

### Restrictiveness

When we asked the survey participants about their thoughts on language restrictiveness, 44.7% of respondents wish that Solidity stays “as is”.

About 35.6% would generally prefer more restrictive/explicit behaviour, while approximately 19.6% would prefer Solidity to be less restrictive.

The overall results of this question are comparable across the previous year and this year.

![Solidity Restrictiveness Ranking](slide64)

### Feedback on New Features/Improvements

Just like last year, we asked the participants about their thoughts on postfix types and functional elements in Solidity.

Here's what we found out about:

1. **Postfix Types:** While 72.5% respondents that formed a majority explicitly said that they either don't like postfix types or don't care, 27.5% said that they like them.

    ![Postfix types](slide65)

2. **Functional Elements:** Almost 60% users said that they like the idea of more functional elements in Solidity such as Lamda functions. 15.4% said they don't like them and 24.7% are indifferent towards it.

    ![Functional Elements](slide66)

### EIP Support

We also wanted to know what Solidity-related EIPs the survey respondents know about or look forward to using and why.

Let's look at some useful insights about:

1. EIP-1153 “Transient Storage”: Roughly a majority of 40.1% respondents know about the Transient Storage EIP, whereas 59.9% do not. 40.4% said that they would need complex types in Transient Storage, such as mappings and arrays, whereas the rest of the audience was equally divided between not needing complex types and being indifferent/unaware of it.

    ![Transient Storage](slide67)
    
    ![Transient Storage: complex types](slide68)

2. EIP-3540 “EOF - EVM Object Format”: It was interesting to see that only 28.6% respondents know about EOF in contrast to the 71.3% majority that does not know about it. Among the 28.6%, 63.5% feel positively about it and only 4.8% are of the opinion that it will negatively impact them as developers.

    ![EOF](slide69)
    ![EOF impact](slide70)

### Language Design Related Efforts

When asked whether the respondents have or continue to participate in the language design efforts, here's what we found:

- A majority of almost 86% respondents said that they do not participate because they are either too busy, or uninterested/underqualified, or do not know how to participate.
- Roughly 14.2% of respondents said that they regularly participate in language design efforts either by joining the calls, the forum discussions, or by proposing new features or language changes on GitHub.
- 18.5% specifically mentioned that the reason for their lack of participation is either lack of interest or skills require in order to participate in these efforts.

At Solidity, we have and would like to continue to make it easier to our community to participate more actively in these discussions and feel empowered enough to contribute to the language design decisions.

![Language design efforts](slide71)

![header 6](/img/2024/survey/header6.png)

## Solidity Developer Community

### Staying up-to-date

A slightly new trend from the previous years is that this year, most people reported that they like to stay up-to-date about Solidity versions, security alerts, and announcements by following the [Solidity GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases), followed by Solidity [Twitter](https://twitter.com/solidity_lang) or [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@solidity).

Other often mentioned means of information is the [Solidity blog](https://blog.soliditylang.org/).

Interestingly, about 21.2% claim to not be doing any of the above.

As part of “other”, respondents specified several community based means to stay up-to-date:

- "Crypto influencers" / Popular Solidity developers
- Discord servers
- Google
- Crypto Twitter / Community chats / Farcaster channels
- Newsletters
- Other blogs such as Moralis and OpenZeppelin
- [Solidity docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/)
- [Solidity website](https://soliditylang.org/)
- Tutorials on YouTube
- Reddit
- ["Week in Ethereum News" Newsletter](https://www.weekinethereumnews.com/)

![Means To Stay Up-To-Date](slide73)

### Interaction with Other Solidity Developers

More than half of respondents (56.8%) interact with other Solidity developers whereas 25.7%  admitted that they rarely interact with other Solidity devs.

A smaller portion of that chart 17.5% does not interact with other Solidity developers at all.

![Developer Interaction](slide74)

Like in the previous years, as the last part of the survey, we wanted to hear how many participants agree or disagree with certain statements regarding the Solidity community and the work of the Solidity team.

**Statement 1:** I feel welcome in the Solidity developer community.

46.8% of respondents feel welcome in the Solidity developer community and 26.1% somehwat agree with the statement. Almost 5% still feel unwelcome.

**Statement 2:** I am confident with the work of the Solidity core team.

A majority of roughly 80% agree or somewhat agree that they feel confident in the work of the Solidity team. A small portion of the survey audience (6.4%) does not agree with this statement.

**Statement 3:** The Solidity team understands my needs as a developer.

About 68% as a majority either agree or somewhat agree with the above statement. 23.2% do not know how they feel about this, whereas about 8.8% of the audience generally disagrees.

**Statement 4:** The options for how to contribute ideas or feedback to Solidity are clear to me.

A majority of 47% of the survey audience agrees that the options for how to contribute ideas or feedback to the team are clear to them. However, almost as high as 26% still aren't clear about how to contribute ideas or feedback. It can be derived from this that communication around this needs to be bolstered.

**Statement 5:** I am receiving adequate feedback from the Solidity team on issues raised on Github and/or forum posts.

A quite high majority (50%) of the audience does not know how to feel about this statement.

However, about 40% respondents are generally satisfied with the feedback and inputs they get from the Solidity team regarding their contributions. Whereas 10% disagree or strongly disagree to this.

The results of this “community and Solidity team confidence ranking” are quite consistent with the results from the previous year.

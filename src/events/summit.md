## The Solidity Summit is a collaborative event focusing on the future of [Solidity](/).

We're excited to bring back Solidity Summit for another edition, again as part of the [Devconnect](https://devconnect.org/) week! 

## Speaker and attendee applications for 2025 are now open!

To apply for a speaking opportunity, please complete the [speaker form](https://drive.argot.org/form/#/2/form/view/TmZlvgY9qObv9P2OIcv91drpWxWm-7OPuyFT4Tgone0/). If you are interested in attending, [please complete the attendee application form](https://drive.argot.org/form/#/2/form/view/6Call76R1Nf3vsaQ2Mhv4VIHuHaT5z274Wz8N3ocQtw/).

Keep in mind that the Solidity Summit is geared towards an experienced audience, which means we could descent deep into the (Solidity) technicalities quickly!

You can follow Solidity on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/solidity_lang) or monitor the [Solidity blog](/blog) to not miss any update about the event.

## Keep up with the newest developments in the Solidity space.

The Solidity Summit is a free interactive forum with discussions and talks on Solidity, Yul, language design, dapps, security and tooling.

During the event you can expect to:

- Get up to speed with the latest language proposals and new features.
- Hear updates from Solidity dapp devs, tooling and security experts.
- Learn from Solidity power users.

We aim to have useful discussions that result in language improvement proposals and ultimately in actual implementations. Furthermore, we want to foster communication between teams working on similar topics, and identify needs for the smart contract ecosystem of Ethereum.

Solidity Summit 2025 is part of [Devconnect ARG](https://devconnect.org/) and will be a one-day forum for the Solidity ecosystem. It is for anyone involved and interested in the Solidity language and the dapps and tooling around it.

## Who can join?

The Solidity Summit focuses on advanced Solidity users and other stakeholders of the Solidity ecosystem, such as dapp developers, tooling builders, auditors and security researchers.

#### Solidity Language Shapers

Experts in Solidity, or other EVM smart contract languages, can share updates, or present improvement ideas and their thoughts.

#### Dapp Developers

Apart from compiler builders/users, we intend to provide a platform for dapp developers to showcase the Solidity language best practices, challenges, and DOs and DON'Ts of building decentralised applications that are powered by Solidity.

#### Tooling Builders, Security Researchers & Auditors

IDE developers, debuggers, analysis tools or testing frameworks can use this occasion to share updates with the audience.

#### Solidity Enthusiasts

Seasoned Solidity users can share their finest Solidity hacks, takes and tips!

## What will we talk about?

This year, presentations and discussions will evolve around the following topics:

- Application development on Ethereum powered by Solidity
- Solidity and Yul
- Language changes or extension proposals
- Long-term future of Solidity (Argot: Solidity's new home, Core Solidity, etc.)
- Feedback on recently introduced features
- Unification / extension of the ABI
- Tooling, debuggers and debugging data output
- Testing frameworks
- Source-code/formal verification
- Layer 2 support, cross-chain support
- Mechanisms / programming patterns (on the EVM) like mutexes, state machines, upgradeable contracts, libraries, create2, etc.
